# IndustrialImageStacker

## Idea
This project aims to use IDS NXT to provide means of immediate ImageStacking and processing for experimental and artistic purposes. As this project is part of a hackathon, no maintenance (due to limited access to hardware) is to be expected.

## Features

### Stack to Single Image
- ####  MaxStacking
Combine a series of images into a single stacked image, finding out the maximum pixel values for each respective pixel. Can be used for painting with light e.g.

- #### MinStacking
Combine a series of images into a single stacked image, finding out the maximum pixel values for each respective pixel. Can be used for creating traces of flying objects like birds, insects, planes etc.

### Stack to Image Sequence
- #### MaxStacking
Like stacking a single image, but in a sequence to display progressive motion of light.

- #### MinStacking
Like stacking a single image, but showing progress being made

- #### AttackDecay
Stacking filter for providing a customizeable fading animation, useful for moving light sources like car headlights, trains, or light painting animation.
